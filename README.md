---- nTask ----
Very simple "to-do" app that allows users to sign in with auth, upload a task to their list and check when the task has been completed.
This app was made with React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and Superagent. React is the front end framework, Superagent is the HTTP client that makes requests to the back end. Express is the middleware that communicates and queries the database.
